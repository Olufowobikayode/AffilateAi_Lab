.
**I. Project Goal & Core Principles:**



* **Goal:** Achieve 1,000,000 combined sales, followers, and engagement across Facebook pages/groups and personal online presence ("Print on demand").

* **Monetization Focus:** Integrate affiliate marketing and sponsored posts as primary revenue streams.

* **Resource Constraint:** Strict adherence to free-tier cloud hosting, databases, APIs, and services.

* **AI Centrality:** Gemini and Openai will power all intelligent decision-making, content creation, and strategic adjustments.



---



**II. Technical Stack (Node.js/TypeScript-centric):**



* **Frontend:** React.js (TypeScript) with Material-UI for an intuitive dashboard.

* **Backend:** Node.js/Express.js (TypeScript) for robust API services and orchestration.





* **Image Storage:** Cloudinary (free tier) for efficient image hosting and delivery.

* **Deployment:** Git for version control.

* **Cloud Hosting:** Free-tier cloud providers (Vercel for frontend, or similar services with generous free tiers and Render for backend, or similar service with generous free tier).

* **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.

* **API Key Management:** Secure environment variables.



---



**III. Core Bot Functionality & Gemini and Openai Integration:**



1. **Multi-Source Trend Fusion & Prioritization:**

* **Data Sources (via free MCPs/APIs):** Facebook Insights API, Google Trends API, Reddit API (e.g., top posts from relevant subreddits) and free scrapping MCPs that can scrape across most social media platforms and E-commerce platforms that supports print on demands

* **Data Fetching:** Schedule automated fetches every 4 hours.

* **Gemini Role:** Analyze incoming data from all sources. Implement a weighting system: Facebook Insights (70%), Google Trends (80%), Reddit (50%), all other platforms (60%), E-commerce platforms (80%). Based on this, identify and rank the **top 3 most viral and relevant content trends plus hashtags and PoD designs** for the target niche.

* **Gemini Output:** A JSON object containing the ranked trends plus hashtags and PoD Designs, their perceived virality score, and a brief justification for each.



2. **AI-Powered Content Generation:**

* **Openai Role:** For each of the top 3 trends and Designs, generate a highly engaging Facebook post and ads post with hashtags.

* **Post Structure:** Each post *must* include:

1. A compelling, shocking statistic related to the trend.

2. A practical, actionable security tip (general digital security, data privacy, or niche-specific if applicable).

3. A direct, open-ended engagement question to prompt comments.

4. 5-10 highly relevant and trending hashtags.

* **Monetization Integration:** Gemini should also suggest natural, contextually relevant placements for affiliate links within the post (e.g., `[AFFILIATE_LINK_PLACEHOLDER]`) and indicate if the post is suitable for sponsored content.

* **Output Format:** Provide generated posts as a JSON array, with fields: `trend_topic`, `post_text`, `hashtags` (array), `affiliate_link_potential` (boolean), `sponsored_post_suitability` (boolean), `PoD Designs` and `image_generation_prompt`.



3. **Automated Image Generation & Upload:**

* **Gemini Role (Image Prompt Generator):** For each generated post, create a vivid and effective prompt for a free-tier AI image generation API (e.g , DeepAI, Pixelcut, or DALL-E's free tier, ensuring commercial use rights).

* **Image Style:** Prompts should aim for "visually striking" and "photorealistic" images, incorporating "digital security elements" (e.g., subtle blockchain visuals, secure lock icons, digital shields, encrypted data motifs) where relevant and tasteful.

* **Image API Interaction:** The backend will use the generated prompt to call the chosen image generation API.

* **Upload & Storage:** Use Facebook Graph API to upload the generated image with its corresponding post. Store a copy of the generated image on Cloudinary (free tier) for an hour after post before deleting.



4. **Automated Engagement & Community Building:**

* **Gemini Role:** Monitor new comments on the bot's Facebook posts. For highly engaged comments, generate natural, concise, and contextually relevant replies designed to foster further discussion and improve post visibility.

* **Prioritization:** Prioritize replying to comments that are questions, express strong opinions, or show high engagement potential.

* **Output Format:** JSON array of `{'comment_id': '...', 'reply_text': '...'}`.

**IV. Automation Workflow & Orchestration (Backend Logic)**



1. **Trend Fetching:** Every 4 hours, initiate data collection from Facebook Insights, Google Trends, and Reddit Â and free scrapping MCPs that can scrape across all other platforms and E-commerce platforms that supports print on demands.

2. **Content Generation & Image Creation:** For the top 3 identified trends, trigger Openai and Gemini to generate post content and DALL-E prompts.

3. **Post Scheduling:** Immediately schedule generated posts (with images and affiliate link placeholders) to designated Facebook pages/groups using Facebook Graph API. Implement a smart scheduling algorithm for optimal reach.

4. **Comment Monitoring & Engagement:** Continuously monitor new comments on the bot's posts. Trigger Gemini to generate replies for suitable comments.

5. **Performance Tracking & Optimization:**

* **Data Collection:** Systematically collect performance metrics from Facebook Insights (reach, engagement, clicks).

* **Gemini Role:** Weekly, analyze performance data (post content, image styles, engagement rates, trends addressed, affiliate link clicks). Generate actionable insights and suggest iterative improvements for future content strategies (e.g., "Increase posts on X topic," "Experiment with Y image style," "Optimize Z call-to-action.").

* **Monetization Reporting:** Present clear analytics on affiliate link performance and sponsored post revenue.



---



**V. Deployment & Security Considerations:**



1. **Containerization:** All services (frontend, backend, database, Redis) must be containerized using Docker for portability and isolation.

2. **Free-Tier Hosting Strategy:** Carefully select and configure free-tier hosting solutions to avoid unexpected costs and maximize uptime within their limits.

3. **CI/CD:** Implement a GitHub Actions workflow for automated build, test, and deployment upon code changes.

4. **Security Measures:**

* Encrypt all API keys and sensitive credentials both at rest and in transit.

* Strictly adhere to Facebook's platform policies and undergo their app review process for all necessary permissions.

* Implement robust rate limiting on all outbound API calls (Facebook, Google Trends, Reddit, DALL-E, etc.) to prevent abuse and adhere to API terms of service.

* Integrate a content moderation layer for all AI-generated output, either using Gemini's and Openai's internal safety filters or an additional free-tier moderation API, to ensure content is appropriate and aligns with platform guidelines.



---



**VI. Final Output Requirement for Gemini:**



Your response should detail:



1. **Pseudocode/High-Level Architecture:** A diagram or text description of the bot's overall architecture and how the components interact.

2. **Function Definition Examples:** Provide 2-3 detailed examples of how you would define specific functions (for Node.js/TypeScript backend) that would be called by Gemini and Openai, demonstrating the input and expected output JSON structures (e.g., `get_top_trends`, `generate_facebook_post`, `reply_to_comment`).

3. **Example Gemini Prompt Structures:** Reiterate and refine the specific prompt templates that would be sent to Gemini for each task (Trend Fusion, Content Generation, Image Prompting, Engagement, Optimization), ensuring they request structured JSON output where applicable.

4. **Free-Tier Resource Suggestions:** List specific free-tier services/platforms for each component (hosting, database, image generation API, Redis) along with any key limitations to be mindful of.
